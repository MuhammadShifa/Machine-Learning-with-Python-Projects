# Machine-Learning-with-Python-Projects

##1 Python Data Preprocessing Techniques
Machine Learning algorithms donâ€™t work so well with processing raw data. Before we can feed such data to an ML algorithm, we must preprocess it. In other words, we must apply some transformations on it. With data preprocessing, we convert raw data into a clean data set.


##2 German-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Benchmark
There are several different types of traffic signs like speed limits, no entry, traffic signals, turn left or right, children crossing, no passing of heavy vehicles, etc. Traffic signs classification is the process of identifying which class a traffic sign belongs to.
In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

For this project, I am using the public dataset available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign):

#####Traffic Signs Dataset
The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The size of the dataset is around 300 MB. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.
